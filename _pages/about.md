I’m a highly motivated and enthusiastic student, passionate about applied mathematics and sciences. Currently 3rd year engineering student at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/">Télécom Paris</a> and ENS Paris-Saclay where I’m pursuing a Msc in Machine Learning. I study Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics.
